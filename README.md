# INVENTORY-MANAGEMENT
Good day, Sir Lamostrre! This is our project in ICT-10 which is about Inventory. We have worked hard to complete this project in the alloted time. We are so thankful for this experience because we have learned a lot while making this project. Thank you for being our ICT-10 teacher, sharing your knowledge to us and for being very considerate in all the things you have tasked us. We hope you have a great day.
